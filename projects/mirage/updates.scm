The [Bromium](http://bromium.com) team were interested in looking at this on their microvisor, and datacenter folks wanted to know if this would help with lightweight datacenter proxies.")

  (descr "Anil Madhavapeddy delivered roughly the same XenSummit talk at the Princeton departmental seminar. There was a *lot* of interest in the software-defined networking libraries, as Princeton has major efforts ongoing to apply high-level programming discipline to network construction. Andrew Appel also described his ongoing Compcert efforts and how Mirage could fit into this in the longer-term.")
